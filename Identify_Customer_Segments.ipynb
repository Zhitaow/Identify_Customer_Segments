    "# Project: Identify Customer Segments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will help you complete this task by providing a framework within which you will perform your analysis steps. In each step of the project, you will see some text describing the subtask that you will perform, followed by one or more code cells for you to complete your work. **Feel free to add additional code and markdown cells as you go along so that you can explore everything in precise chunks.** The code cells provided in the base template will outline only the major tasks, and will usually not be enough to cover all of the minor tasks that comprise it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that while there will be precise guidelines on how you should handle certain tasks in the project, there will also be places where an exact specification is not provided. **There will be times in the project where you will need to make and justify your own decisions on how to treat the data.** These are places where there may not be only one way to handle the data. In real-life tasks, there may be many valid ways to approach an analysis task. One of the most important things you can do is clearly document your approach so that other scientists can understand the decisions you've made.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of most sections, there will be a Markdown cell labeled **Discussion**. In these cells, you will report your findings for the completed section, as well as document the decisions that you made in your approach to each subtask. **Your project will be evaluated not just on the code used to complete the tasks outlined, but also your communication about your observations and conclusions at each stage.**"

First of all, you should assess the demographics data in terms of missing data. Pay attention to the following points as you perform your analysis, and take notes on what you observe. Make sure that you fill in the **Discussion** cell with your findings and decisions at the end of each step that has one!\n",

    "#### Step 1.1.1: Convert Missing Value Codes to NaNs\n",
    "The fourth column of the feature attributes summary (loaded in above as `feat_info`) documents the codes from the data dictionary that indicate missing or unknown data. While the file encodes this as a list (e.g. `[-1,0]`), this will get read in as a string object. You'll need to do a little bit of parsing to make use of it to identify and clean the data. Convert data that matches a 'missing' or 'unknown' value code into a numpy NaN value. You might want to see how much data takes on a 'missing' or 'unknown' code, and how much data is naturally missing, as a point of interest.\n",

    "To recap, we find that about 6 features with NaN occupancy rate above 30%. In descending order, they are: <strong>TITEL_KZ</strong> (99%), <strong>AGER_TYP</strong> (77%), <strong>KK_KUNDENTYP</strong> (66%), <strong>KBA05_BAUMAX</strong> (54%), <strong>GEBURTSJAHR</strong> (44%), <strong>ALTER_HH</strong> (35%). They can be identified as outliers as clearly shown by the histogram distribution. In further data processing, we can just simply rule out these features. The rest of features are heavily weighted in the 0~20% bucket, part of which share very similar pattern: all sub-features that belong to the same category can have the missing data simultaneously. This occurs when there is no information available for this category."

Divide the data into two subsets: one for data points that are above some threshold for missing values, and a second subset for points below that threshold.\n",

If the distributions of non-missing features look similar between the data with many missing values and the data with few or no missing values, then we could argue that simply dropping those points from the analysis won't present a major issue. On the other hand, if the data with many missing values looks very different from the data with few or no missing values, then we should make a note on those data as special. Make sure you report your observations in the discussion section. **Either way, you should continue your analysis below using just the subset of the data with few or no missing values.**"

    "#### Discussion 1.1.3: Assess Missing Data in Each Row\n",
    "\n",
    "(Double-click this cell and replace this text with your own text, reporting your observations regarding missing data in rows. Are the data with lots of missing values are qualitatively different from data with few or no missing values?)\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Answer</strong>: The histogram distribution (the first plot in Step 1.1.3) shows that most data peaks around 0% missing values, and decays quickly. Only a few outliers lies in the 30% buckets and above. Therefore, we can use 30% as a threshold to separate these outliers from the normal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these outliers only consist of 10% of the total population, we should pay attention because their distributions in some features are quite different from the majority group (below the threshold), as shown by the count plot in the second plot above. In some features, such as <strong>ANREDE_KZ</strong> (associated with the gender), <strong>NATIONALITAET_KZ</strong> (associated with the originality), the distribution of the two groups are very similar to each other. However, many features show quite different distribution: the outlier spike in \"7\" buckets in <strong>SEMIO_REL</strong> (associated with personality), and \"5\" in <strong>FINANZ_UNAUFFAELLIGER</strong> (associated with financial typology). Therefore, the statistics suggest treat these two populations are quite distinct from each other. In the following analysis, we will flag the data with row missing values above the threshold, and only focus on studying the majority group with few or no missing values."

    "### Step 1.2: Select and Re-Encode Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking for missing data isn't the only way in which you can prepare a dataset for analysis. Since the unsupervised learning techniques to be used will only work on data that is encoded numerically, you need to make a few encoding changes or additional assumptions to be able to make progress. In addition, while almost all of the values in the dataset are encoded using numbers, not all of them represent numeric values. Check the third column of the feature summary (`feat_info`) for a summary of types of measurement.\n",

    "- For binary (two-level) categoricals that take numeric values, you can keep them without needing to do anything.\n",
    "- There is one binary variable that takes on non-numeric values. For this one, you need to re-encode the values as numbers or create a dummy variable.\n",
    "- For multi-level categoricals (three or more values), you can choose to encode the values using multiple dummy variables (e.g. via [OneHotEncoder](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html)), or (to keep things straightforward) just drop them from the analysis. As always, document your choices in the Discussion section."

While there aren't enough levels to disentangle east from west, you should create two new variables to capture the other two dimensions: an interval-type variable for decade, and a binary variable for movement.\n",

The two features should definely be re-engineered since they are mixture of multiple features and the numbering do not reflect their ordinal nature. \n",

    "\n",
    "Before we apply dimensionality reduction techniques to the data, we need to perform feature scaling so that the principal component vectors are not influenced by the natural differences in scale for features. Starting from this part of the project, you'll want to keep an eye on the [API reference page for sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) to help you navigate to all of the classes and functions that you'll need. In this substep, you'll need to check the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sklearn requires that data not have missing values in order for its estimators to work properly. So, before applying the scaler to your data, make sure that you've cleaned the DataFrame of the remaining missing values before applying your scaler. This can be as simple as just removing all data points with missing data, or applying an [Imputer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer.html) to replace all missing values. You might also try a more complicated procedure where you temporarily remove missing values in order to compute the scaling parameters before re-introducing those missing values and applying imputation. Think about how much missing data you have and what possible effects each approach might have on your analysis, and justify your decision in the discussion section below.\n",
    "- For the actual scaling function, a [StandardScaler](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html) instance is suggested, scaling each feature to mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n",
    "- For these classes, you can make use of the `.fit_transform()` method to both fit a procedure to the data as well as apply the transformation to the data at the same time. Don't forget to keep the fit sklearn objects handy, since you'll be applying them to the customer demographics data towards the end of the project."

    "\n",
    "<strong>Answer</strong>: Applying feature scaling requires non-missing values in the maxtrix. Two common ways are considered to deal with the missing values: 1. dropping rows with any missing values from the dataset; 2. applying imputation. Since the dataset contains considerable amount of rows with more than one missing value (20% of the total population), the former one is not the optimal approach in this case. Here, I used to imputation method. Prior to the step of creating dummy variables, the missing values in each column have been replaced with the mode in the corresponding column. Next, I scaled each feature to its mean, normalized by its standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another more trivial approach before feature scaling, as mentioned in the text: temporarily remove missing values to compute the scaling parameters before re-introducing those missing values and applying imputation. Given that each feature in this dataset contains only about 5% missing data on average, I think that the result of feature scaling with extra step to removing and then re-introducing the missing data may play limited differences in the statistics."

Try plotting the cumulative or sequential values using matplotlib's [`plot()`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html) function. Based on what you find, select a value for the number of transformed features you'll retain for the clustering part of the project.\n",

    "Now that we have our transformed principal components, it's a nice idea to check out the weight of each variable on the first few components to see if they can be interpreted in some fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, each principal component is a unit vector that points in the direction of highest variance (after accounting for the variance captured by earlier principal components). The further a weight is from zero, the more the principal component is in the direction of the corresponding feature. If two features have large weights of the same sign (both positive or both negative), then increases in one tend expect to be associated with increases in the other. To contrast, features with different signs can be expected to show a negative correlation: increases in one variable should result in a decrease in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To investigate the features, you should map each weight to their corresponding feature name, then sort the features according to weight. The most interesting features for each principal component, then, will be those at the beginning and end of the sorted list. Use the data dictionary document to help you understand these most prominent features, their relationships, and what a positive or negative value on the principal component might indicate.\n",
    "- You should investigate and interpret feature associations from the first three principal components in this substep. To help facilitate this, you should write a function that you can call at any time to print the sorted list of feature weights, for the *i*-th principal component. This might come in handy in the next step of the project, when you interpret the tendencies of the discovered clusters."

    "### Discussion 2.3: Interpret Principal Components\n",
    "\n",
    "(Double-click this cell and replace this text with your own text, reporting your observations from detailed investigation of the first few principal components generated. Can we interpret positive and negative values from them in a meaningful way?)\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Answer</strong>: Yes, the results from above clearly indicate feature association with the pricipal components. Below are more detailed interpretation. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the first principal component, it is likely to group features related to financial and social status. The positive weights indicate lower income, and social status. For instance, the dummy variable <strong>LP_STATUS_GROB_1.0</strong> = 1 indicates a positive direction towards lower income earners (as shown by the data dictionary). And the same is true in the case of <strong>HH_EINKOMMEN_SCORE</strong>, with a higher score indicating lower household income. Another features showing a negative weight is the <strong>FINANZ_MINIMALIST</strong>, with higher value indicating lower financial interest (meaning better financial credit). \n",
    "\n",
    "The second principal component binds elderly-related features together. For example, <strong>ALTERSKATEGORIE_GROB</strong> is the age postulated from the person's name, which weights in the positive direction, with a higher value indicating an elder age. In contrast, <strong>SEMIO_TRADV</strong> shows a negative weight. It can interpreted from the dictionary that a higher score indicating less tradional-minded, and therefore younger age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the third component is related to the gender, as supported by the positive feature <strong>ANREDE_KZ_1</strong> (male) and the negative feature <strong>ANREDE_KZ_2</strong> (female). Some other features related to the personality, such as <strong>SEMIO_DOM</strong> (dominant-minded), <strong>SEMIO_FAM</strong> (family-minded), and <strong>SEMIO_KAEM</strong> (combative attitude), are also indirect but very useful information to differentiate a men or women."

    "## Step 3: Clustering\n",

    "### Step 3.1: Apply Clustering to General Population\n",
    "\n",
    "You've assessed and cleaned the demographics data, then scaled and transformed them. Now, it's time to see how the data clusters in the principal components space. In this substep, you will apply k-means clustering to the dataset and use the average within-cluster distances from each point to their assigned cluster's centroid to decide on a number of clusters to keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use sklearn's [KMeans](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html#sklearn.cluster.KMeans) class to perform k-means clustering on the PCA-transformed data.\n",
    "- Then, compute the average difference from each point to its assigned cluster's center. **Hint**: The KMeans object's `.score()` method might be useful here, but note that in sklearn, scores tend to be defined so that larger is better. Try applying it to a small, toy dataset, or use an internet search to help your understanding.\n",
    "- Perform the above two steps for a number of different cluster counts. You can then see how the average distance decreases with an increasing number of clusters. However, each additional cluster provides a smaller net benefit. Use this fact to select a final number of clusters in which to group the data. **Warning**: because of the large size of the dataset, it can take a long time for the algorithm to resolve. The more clusters to fit, the longer the algorithm will take. You should test for cluster counts through at least 10 clusters to get the full picture, but you shouldn't need to test for a number of clusters above about 30.\n",
    "- Once you've selected a final number of clusters to use, re-fit a KMeans instance to perform the clustering operation. Make sure that you also obtain the cluster assignments for the general demographics data, since you'll be using them in the final Step 3.3."

    "\n",
    "<strong>Answer</strong>: I picked 15 clusters to segment the population. The scree plot on the left panel above shows that the average distance (SSE) decreases with the number of clusters monotonically. To find the elbow at which decreasing in the distance is not substantial enough to suggest the need for an additional cluster, I calculated their first derivative (the slope) with respect to the number of clusters, as shown in the right panel. With increased clusters, the slope starts to stablize around 11-15 clusters. "

Take care to not confuse this for re-fitting all of the models to the customer data.

In the last step of the project, you will interpret how the general population fits apply to the customer data.\n",

That is, you should not be using a `.fit()` or `.fit_transform()` method to re-fit the old objects, nor should you be creating new sklearn objects! Carry the data through the feature scaling, PCA, and clustering steps, obtaining cluster assignments for all of the data in the customer demographics data."

    "### Step 3.3: Compare Customer Data to Demographics Data\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you have clustered data based on demographics of the general population of Germany, and seen how the customer data for a mail-order sales company maps onto those demographic clusters. In this final substep, you will compare the two cluster distributions to see where the strongest customer base for the company is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the proportion of persons in each cluster for the general population, and the proportions for the customers. If we think the company's customer base to be universal, then the cluster assignment proportions should be fairly similar between the two. If there are only particular segments of the population that are interested in the company's products, then we should see a mismatch from one to the other. If there is a higher proportion of persons in a cluster for the customer data compared to the general population (e.g. 5% of persons are assigned to a cluster for the general population, but 15% of the customer data is closest to that cluster's centroid) then that suggests the people in that cluster to be a target audience for the company. On the other hand, the proportion of the data in a cluster being larger in the general population than the customer data (e.g. only 2% of customers closest to a population centroid that captures 6% of the data) suggests that group of persons to be outside of the target demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the following points in this step:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the proportion of data points in each cluster for the general population and the customer data. Visualizations will be useful here: both for the individual dataset proportions, but also to visualize the ratios in cluster representation between groups. Seaborn's [`countplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.countplot.html) or [`barplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.barplot.html) function could be handy.\n",
    "  - Recall the analysis you performed in step 1.1.3 of the project, where you separated out certain data points from the dataset if they had more than a specified threshold of missing values. If you found that this group was qualitatively different from the main bulk of the data, you should treat this as an additional data cluster in this analysis. Make sure that you account for the number of data points in this subset, for both the general population and customer datasets, when making your computations!\n",
    "- Which cluster or clusters are overrepresented in the customer dataset compared to the general population? Select at least one such cluster and infer what kind of people might be represented by that cluster. Use the principal component interpretations from step 2.3 or look at additional components to help you make this inference. Alternatively, you can use the `.inverse_transform()` method of the PCA and StandardScaler objects to transform centroids back to the original data space and interpret the retrieved values directly.\n",
    "- Perform a similar investigation for the underrepresented clusters. Which cluster or clusters are underrepresented in the customer dataset compared to the general population, and what kinds of people are typified by these clusters?"

    "\n",
    "<strong>Answer</strong>: The countplot above clearly shows that the customers in Cluster 11 overrepresents the general population (24% vs. 10%), suggesting the general population in this cluster shall be targeted as highly-potential customers. On the other hand, the customers in Cluster 2 shows the oppositve trend, an underrepresentation of the general demongraphics (around 1% vs 10%). Therefore, this market segment of general population is of our least interest, since customers of this kind are unlikely to place mailed order. Note that Cluster 15 is mannualy added to represent the group of data with lots of missing values. The customer dataset contains more than 25% high-NaN data of its total population. \n",
    "\n",
    "By projecting the fitted Kmean-centroids back to the original feature space, I compared several features of the two clusters of people, based on their income level, age, gender, movement, and living location, as shown by the table above.  To interpret this table, for Cluster 11 (overrepresenting) as an example, the first row <strong>HH_EINKOMMEN_SCORE</strong> scales the estimated household net income from 1 to 6, with higher scores indicating lower income. Cluster 11 has a value of 2.37, falling into the range betwen \"very high income\" and \"high income\" according to the data dictionary. The <strong>LP_STATUS_GROB_X.0</strong> are dummy variables converted from <strong>LP_STATUS_GROB</strong>, a rough scale on the social status. Here, Cluster 11 are heavily weighted on the LP_STATUS_GROB_5.0 bucket (96.3%), corresponds to \"top earners\" in the dictionary, which is consistent with <strong>HH_EINKOMMEN_SCORE</strong>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the characteristics of above features, we can conclude that the most overrepresenting cluster is the group of people with high-income, in their middle-age borned in 40-50s, involved in green avantgarde, and mostly living in the area of former West Germany. People in the underrepresenting cluster trend to be on the opposite side: they are lower income earners, mainly younger female borned in the 80-90s, and not a member of green avantgarde."

Once you've checked over all of your work, you should export the notebook as an HTML document to submit for evaluation. You can do this from the menu, navigating to **File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)**. You will submit both that document and this notebook for your project submission."
